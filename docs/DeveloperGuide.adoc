[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete|1`.

.Component interactions for `delete|1` command

image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]
The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ViewPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to user's input so that the UI can be updated with the modified data in `Model`.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `XpireParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an item).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete|1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete|1` Command
image::LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Xpire and ReplenishList data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageComponentClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Xpire and ReplenishList data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `io.xpire.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Replenish List
// tag::replenishListItems[]

==== Items in the replenish list

===== Implementation
//{Explain here how the ToReplenish/ToBuy List is implemented}_
Items are added to the replenish list by the user using the `ShiftCommand`.
When an item expires, the item is automatically tagged as `#Expired`.

.All expired items are automatically tagged with the `Expired` tag (circled in figure).
image::expired_tags.png[]

By searching for the `Expired` tag using the `SearchCommand`, the user is able to retrieve a list of expired items.

.Sequence Diagram for ItemManager Class
image::ItemManagerSequenceDiagram.png[]

On the other hand, when an item has run out, an item is automatically added to the replenish list.
This occurs when the user uses the `DeleteCommand` to
The following sequence diagram summarises how this operation works:

.Sequence Diagram when item quantity is reduced to 0 via the Delete Command

//Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

//The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

===== Design Considerations
//===== Aspect: Data structure to store the items
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice): **
//** Pros:
//** Cons:
//
//* **Alternative 2:**
//** Pros:
//** Cons:
====== Aspect: How expired items are being handled
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Once an item expires,
the item is automatically tagged as `#Expired`.**
** Pros: Makes good use of existing `SearchCommand`, where user can search for the `#Expired` tag to view list of expired items.
** Cons: User has to manually type in a short command to add an item to the replenish list.

* **Alternative 2: Once an item expires, item is automatically transferred to the replenish list.**
** Pros: User need not manually key in item details to transfer it to the replenish list.
** Cons: User does not have the flexibility to pick which items to transfer to the replenish list.
// end::replenishListItems[]

// tag::replenishListCommands[]
==== Commands in the replenish list

===== Implementation
As shown in a snippet of the `Logic` class diagram below, both `XpireParser` and `ReplenishParser` implement the interface `Parser`.
In particular, `ReplenishParser` parses and handles the commands in the replenish list.

.Snippet of Logic class diagram to highlight the relationship between the parsers
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Certain commands such as sorting by date, or deleting
of item quantities are not permitted, as items in the replenish list do not have expiry dates or quantities.

The activity diagram below follows the general path of a command executed in either the main tracking list `Xpire`, or the
replenish list.

.Activity Diagram for general parsing of commands
image::ParseCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

In the event that `ReplenishParser` is selected, it will prevent any invalid or prohibited commands and also check for spelling mistakes in the user input.
This will be further explained to you in a <<Spelling correction with alternative recommendations,later section>>.

===== Design Considerations
When designing the replenish list, I had to make decisions on how best to parse and execute commands in an efficient manner
that would minimise code repetition and delay in runtime. The following is a brief summary of
my analysis and decisions.

====== Aspect: How commands are executed in the list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Create two separate parsers, one for the main tracking list and another for the replenish list.**
** Pros: This allows us to reuse existing commands that are currently functional for the main tracking list in the replenish list as well, without extensive repetition of code.
** Cons: This would require us to check which parser is to be used every time a command is executed.

* **Alternative 2: Create two versions of each command, one for each list.**
** Pros: This allows us to greatly customise the command for each list.
** Cons: This however would lead to unnecessary repetition of code across the code base.
// end::replenishListCommands[]

// tag::autosortPartOne[]
=== Auto-sorting of items by name then date
==== Implementation
Items in both lists are automatically sorted by their name then date in chronological order.
This auto-sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortedUniqueXpireItemList` and `SortedUniqueReplenishItemList`
that both implement `SortedUniqueItemList`, in a relationship summarised in the diagram below.

.Snippet of Model class diagram to bring attention to the relationship between internal sorted lists
image::SortedUniqueItemListClassDiagram.png[]

In both `SortedUniqueXpireItemList` and `SortedUniqueReplenishItemList`, items are stored in a `SortedList<Item>` and
subsequently sorted based on the comparator defined. `SortedUniqueXpireItemList` supports a new function, `SortedUniqueItemList#setMethodOfSorting()`, that specifies the
`MethodOfSorting` and comparator to be used for the list.

The following sequence diagrams break down the intricacies in the view operation that works to display the sorted items in each list:

.Sequence Diagram illustrating how the view operation displays items in order
image::AutoSortViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Parsers are omitted from the diagram above to place greater emphasis on the parser selection process and sorting mechanism.

The figure above shows a `view|replenish` command executed to change the current view from that of the main tracking list `Xpire`
to the replenish list, while the figure below initialises this process.

.Sequence Diagram : setting the parser
image::ViewSetParserSequenceDiagram.png[]

`LogicManager` creates and allocates a parser to parse commands entered by the user each time. It does so by first identifying the current view
displayed. In this example, the current view is found to be `XPIRE`, and thus `XpireParser` is selected. Following that,
new objects `ViewCommandParser` and `ViewCommand` are created and returned to `LogicManager` to be used in the execution of the `view|replenish` command.
The figure below pictures the process of retrieving the internal sorted list of items in `ReplenishList`.

.Sequence Diagram : retrieve internal sorted list
image::AutoSortViewPartSequenceDiagram.png[]
As items in the replenish list lack expiry dates, the command to sort by date is rendered irrelevant and thereby disallowed entirely in the replenish list.
Instead, items are automatically sorted by their names. Therefore, in the diagram above, a `nameComparator` is always returned by default.

[NOTE]
The list returned is the sortedInternalList wrapped as an unmodifiable list.

`this.internalUnmodifiableList = FXCollections.unmodifiableList(this.sortedInternalList);`

[NOTE]
Every time view is called, the current method of sorting specified is retrieved. If it has not been explicitly specified,
the default method of sorting is then retrieved.

<<<
// end::autosortPartOne[]

// tag::autosortPartTwo[]
The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the sort command changes the default order of items displayed:

.Sequence Diagram showing how sort command changes the order of items
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
When sort is called, the method of sorting is redefined by the user.

In this example, the user has chosen to re-sort the items by date. As indicated above, `ParserUtil` primarily verifies that the method of sorting is valid, i.e. either name or date. Next, `s`,
the `SortCommand` object created executes the `sort|date` command. The figure below exhibits the specific process which sorts the items by their expiry dates.

.Sequence Diagram : set method of sorting to date
image::SortPartSequenceDiagram.png[]

In the above example, the user has specified to sort items by their expiry date, thus a dateComparator is returned.

[NOTE]
The SortedList changes accordingly based on the method of sorting specified.

`sortedInternalList = new SortedList<>(internalList, methodOfSorting.getComparator());`

The activity diagram below details the explicit steps in the execution of a sort command.

.Activity Diagram showing the control flow of a sort command executed by the user
image::SortActivityDiagram.png[]

If a `sort|date` command is executed, the comparator of the internal sorted list is set to be that of a `dateComparator`,
and the list of items are updated accordingly.

[NOTE]
The ability to check for spelling errors of command arguments is explained in a <<Spelling correction with alternative recommendations,later section>>.
// end::autosortPartTwo[]

// tag::autosortPartThree[]
==== Design Considerations
In the process of actualising this feature, I contemplated on when items should be automatically sorted by name and displayed.
I also tried and tested varied options to derive an optimal data structure to store the sorted items. The following is a brief summary of my analysis and decisions.

===== Aspect: When items auto-sorted by their names are displayed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display the sorted list of items when items are viewed.
** Pros: Does not reset the method of sorting back to name by default with the addition of every item.
** Cons: The user might not be able to find items added solely by their names.

* **Alternative 2:** Display the sorted list of items with the addition of every item.
** Pros: Allows the user to find any added item with ease as items are sorted by their name in chronological order.
** Cons: Resets the method of sorting back to name by default every time an item is added.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the auto-sorted items
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `SortedList<Item>`.
** Pros: Smooth integration with the internal ObservableList. Comparator can also be easily changed when necessary.
** Cons: Sorted List can only be viewed when `asUnmodifiableObservableList()` in `SortedUniqueItemList` is called.

* **Alternative 2:** `TreeSet<Item>`.
** Pros: Disallows addition of identical items to the set.
** Cons: May not be as compatible with the internalList which is of type ObservableList.
// end::autosortPartThree[]

// tag::setreminder[]
=== Reminders for expiring items

The reminder function comprises two parts. Firstly, user sets a date designated to active the reminder through the command
`set reminder`. Then, user will be able to find all items whose reminder has been activated at present through the command `check`. +
There is also an enhanced function which allows the user to filter items expiring within a specified number of days,
 through the `check|<days>` command.

==== Implementation

===== Set reminder
The set reminder function is implemented in a similar way as delete, add and tag. It is facilitated by the method `setItem` in `Model`
where the old item in `Xpire` will be replaced by a new item with an updated value for the field `ReminderThreshold`.
It is activated using the command `set reminder`.

You can refer to the example usage scenario given below to see what happens at each stage of the execution.

Scenario: the user wants to set a reminder for an item with index 1 in the current view of the list
1 day before its expiry date.

Step 1: the user input is parsed by `SetReminderCommandParser` to check validity of the reminder threshold.

Step 2: the `SetReminderCommandParser` creates a `SetReminderCommand` object if the input is valid. The `SetReminderCommand` contains a
 new `ReminderThreshold` object. The `SetReminderCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager` and executed.

Step 3: during the execution, a copy of the old item with the new `ReminderThreshold` will be created. The copy will replace the old one
in the `Xpire` by `ModelManager`.

Step 4: result of execution will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the operation works:

.SetReminderSequenceDiagram

image::SetReminderUML.png[]

===== Check
The basic check function uses the `updateFilteredItemList` method provided by model to filter items whose reminder has been activated.
The predicate used by the filtering method is named `ReminderThresholdExceededPredicate`.

The `ReminderThresholdExceededPredicate` will check whether the number of days to an item's expiry date is smaller than or equal to its reminder
 threshold.

You can see how the `Check` operation works in the following sequence diagram.

.CheckSequenceDiagram

image::CheckCommandNoArgUML.png[]

A successful `check` will lists all items marked as yellow and red int he `ViewPanel` of the UI component.

===== Check with days
The enhanced check function also uses the `updateFilteredItemList` method provided by model to filter items. The condition
for filtering is that the user input number of days is smaller than or equal to the number of days to an item's expiry date. This is
done by the predicate named `ExpiringSoonPredicate`.

You can see how the `Check|<days>` operation works in the following sequence diagram.

.CheckDaysSequenceDiagram


image::CheckCommandArgUML.png[]

//The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a set reminder command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How set reminder executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set new item to replace the original one in `Xpire`
** Pros: removes unwanted dependency as modifying the item directly in `SetReminderCommand` class requires the original `XpireItemList`
to be passed to the class and could possibly result in unwanted modification. Using a `ObservableList` instead prevents any changes to the item by
the `SetReminderCommand` class.
** Cons: Time complexity is O(nlogn). Despite setting a reminder will not result in change in name or expiry date of the item, and thus
requires no change to the sorted list, the list will still be sorted as a new item is considered added to the list.

* **Alternative 2:** Modify the original item
** Pros: Time complexity is low: O(n) to locate the item.
** Cons: This is dangerous as modifying items in a sorted list is prone to unwanted side effects and undesirable modifications.
// end::setreminder[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CloneModel` and `StackManager`.
It is a separate class that stores a state of the model at any command in time. Internally, it runs three private functions that copy the data over.

The mechanism is supported by a StackManager which stores internally all the states and +
decides when to pop or clear, depending on the command.
There are two stacks that are stored in StackManager internally, the Undo and the Redo stack.
These stacks are initialised and cleared upon beginning/ending every session.

At every command (Other than undo/redo/help/exit), the state is stored internally. +
When an undo command is executed, it will pop the previous state and update the model via `updateModel`. +
The state that was undid will then be pushed into the Redo stack, should the user types in a redo command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The two internal stacks in `StackManager` will be initialised.

Both stacks should be empty as there are no previous commands by the user. The current state is s0, the initial state of Xpire.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep1.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete|5` command to delete the 5th item in Xpire. The `delete` will then save the previous state, s0 by pushing it into the Undo Stack.

The current state will be the new state `s1` that has the 5th item in Xpire deleted.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep2.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add|Apple|30/10/2019|3` to add a new item. Similar to Step 2, The `add` command will then save the previous state, s1 by pushing it into the Undo Stack.

The current state will be the new state `s2` with the item Apple added.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep3.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not save the previous state, thus the Xpire state will not be pushed into the UndoStack.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will then update the current model with the model in the previous state.

Internally within StackManager, the most recent state, s1, will be popped from the Undo Stack to become the current state. At the same time, s2, the new state with the added item, will be pushed into the Redo Stack.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep4.png[]

[NOTE]
If there are no commands to undo (e.g. at the start of a new Xpire session), undo will return an Error to the user instead. This is done by checking whether the UndoStack is empty.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- It will pop the latest state from the Redo Stack and set it as the current state whilst pushing the current state into the Undo Stack.

[NOTE]
Similarly, if there are no commands to redo, redo will return an Error to the user. This is done by checking if the Redo Stack is empty.

From Step 4, there are 3 scenarios which showcases the behaviour of StackManager after an Undo Command has been executed.

Step 5a. The user suddenly decides that he should not have undid the previous AddCommand, thus he wants to redo the action. This is done by inputting 'redo' in Xpire.

Internally within Stack Manager, the current state will be the popped state, s2, from the Redo Stack. The current state, s1, will then be psuehd back into the Undo Stack.

The current states and their locations should be the same as after the execution of the Add command in Step 3.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5a.png[]

Step 5b. The user decides to further undo his actions, which now includes the first Delete command. The initial state, s0, will then be popped from the Undo Stack and set as the current state.

The current state, s1, will then be pushed into the Redo Stack.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5b.png[]

Step 5c. The user may also decide to execute some other command (which is the most likely scenario) other than Undo/Redo. For instance, the user inputs `tag|2|#Fruit`.

When this happens, the existing states in the Redo Stack will be cleared. The state s1, will then be pushed into the Undo Stack whilst the current state will be the new state s3 that includes the new Tag command.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5c.png[]

[PROPOSED] A CommandHistory will also be integrated into the application so that it delivers feedback on what commands it has undo/redo.

[NOTE]
Not all commands will save states to StackManager. Exit and Help commands will not save states. Undo and Redo commands should only act on commands that update the items or change the view of the items to the user.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire model.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the item being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. +
Hard to do when we are applying stackable search/sort commands.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of model states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update the filtered list shown to the user and the backend Xpire data.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::search[]
=== Search

This feature allows users to filter out specific items either by name or by tag(s) through providing the relevant keyword(s). Items which contain any of the keywords will be shown on the view panel. For search by name, partial words can be matched. For search by tag, only exact words will be matched.

This implementation is under `Logic` and `Model` components.

==== Implementation

Below is the UML sequence diagram of an example usage scenario.

image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::search[]

// tag::recommendationsIntro[]
=== Spelling correction with alternative recommendations
==== Implementation
Invalid commands are checked for spelling mistakes.
The spelling correction mechanism is based primarily on the Damerau–Levenshtein distance algorithm, which computes the edit distance between two strings.
This distance is based on the number of substitutions, deletions, insertions or transpositions of characters, needed to convert the source string into the target string.
Relevant functions supporting this operation are implemented in `StringUtil`.

[NOTE]
Only keywords with edit distance of less than 2 are recommended, to filter away less similar word recommendations.
// end::recommendationsIntro[]

The diagram below is a simplified illustration of how the feature works.

.Example showing what happens when "search|applee" is executed with "apple" misspelled

image::RecommendationsExample1.png[]

// tag::recommendationsPartOne[]
[NOTE]
The recommendations will be made solely based on the list of items previously displayed rather than all items currently in the list.

As shown in the diagram below, `Banana` was not recommended even though it exists in the original list. This is because it had been filtered from the previous list prior to when the second search command was executed.
On the other hand, if `green` was misspelled as `gren`, the algorithm will be able to identify `green` as the closest match, as `Green Apple` is present in the previous list.

// end::recommendationsPartOne[]

// tag::recommendationsPartTwo[]

//Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

The figure below depicts the flow of events that check for spelling errors when a user executes an unknown command.

.Activity diagram showing what happens when an unknown command is executed

image::RecommendUnknownCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

For example, if `set reminder` was input incorrectly as `set remindre`, it will be flagged as an invalid command.
It is then compared with an collection of all possible command words in the existing list. `set reminder` will be established
as its closest match and wrapped as a recommendation in a `ParseException` object to be thrown and displayed to the user.
// end::recommendationsPartTwo[]

// tag::recommendationsPartThree[]
The figure below presents what happens when a user executes a command with invalid arguments.

.Activity diagram showing what happens when an a command is executed with misspelled arguments

image::RecommendCommandArgumentsActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Only search and sort commands support this operation.

In the example below encapsulated in a sequence diagram, the user has misspelled "date" as "dat" in a sort command.

.Sequence diagram illustrating the recommendations mechanism for command "sort|dat"

image::RecommendationsSortSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram titled `find similar words` below expands on the process omitted above.

.Sequence diagram showing how "date" is found to be the most similar word to "dat"

image::FindSimilarSequenceDiagram.png[]

The function `findSimilar` in `StringUtil` is called upon to return a set containing strings that are most similar to the misspelled argument, `dat`.
In this process, `dat` is compared with a set of valid inputs, i.e. both `name` and `date`, and the corresponding edit distances are stored.
`getSuggestions("dat")` then filters the results and finds `date` to be the best match.

At last, a `ParseException` which contains the recommendation `date`
is then thrown to the user as feedback.

==== Design Considerations
When tasked to implement this feature, I had to decide on what was the best way to display any form of recommendations to the user.
I also evaluated multiple options to derive an optimal data structure to store the recommendations. The following is a brief summary of my analysis and decisions.

===== Aspect: How recommendations execute

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays recommendations after user inputs command that fails to produce results.
** Pros: Simpler and straightforward implementation.
** Cons: May be less intuitive to the user as opposed to auto-completed commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Auto-completion of commands.
** Pros: Lowers likelihood of spelling mistakes in user input to begin with.
** Cons: We must ensure that the structure of every single command and their variations are taken into consideration.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the recommendations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a TreeMap to store entries that comprise a set of recommendations and their corresponding edit distance.
** Pros: Entries are automatically sorted by their edit distance, thus words with a smaller edit distance will be recommended first. Duplicate entries are also prohibited.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Store all possible recommendations in a long list.
** Pros: Simpler implementation.
** Cons: Not closely related words may also be recommended to the user.
// end::recommendationsPartThree[]

=== Retrieval of Previous Commands

The retrieval of previous commands and later commands are achieved through the `InputHistoryManager` class which implements `HistoryManager` interface.
The `CommandBox` listens to the keyboard event kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓] when user types in the `CommandBox`.

Every user input that is non-blank will be saved as a String before execution by the `save(String)` method of `InputHistoryManager`. You can refer to the following
steps for the retrieval of a *previous* command.

. Step 1: `CommandBox` listens to the KeyPressed event and makes a call to `handleUpKey()` when an up key is pressed.
. Step 2: `handleUpKey()` checks whether the current input is successfully executed or rejected as an invalid command. This makes a difference
because successful commands are erased after execution while invalid commands remain in the `CommandBox`.
. Step 3: If the command is valid and erased, `InputHistoryManager` will try to retrieve the previous command by calling `previous()`.
. Step 4: `CommandBox` will set its text to be the returned String.

[NOTE]
If the current input has not been executed or has already been successfully executed, calling the previous command will return the command
entered before the current input. If the current input is a rejected invalid command, it means that the command has already been
saved. In this case, calling `previous()` once will retrieve back that invalid command which to user means that the command in the `CommandBox`
has not been changed despite the up key pressed. Hence, two calls to `previous()` will be made to retrieve the command before the current invalid command.

=== User Interface Update
The UI contains two panels that change according to the items in the `XpireItemList` and `ReplenishList`. However, these
UI components are not able to update by listening to changes in these `ObservableLists`. This is because both lists are
sorted and thus all items in the lists will be modified each time a `sort`, `add`, `delete`, `tag` or other commands that modify the lists
are executed, causing the listener in the API to catch unwanted changes. Instead, the lists are passed as parameters to the
UI classes through `MainWindow` and rendered each time a command is executed.

As as an example of how the UI were implemented, we will examine the implementation of `ViewPanel`.

==== The View Panel
`ViewPanel` is a container for many `ItemCards`, each carrying information about the items. +
Given below are the steps of an example scenario of how `ViewPanel` is constructed and updated:

. The User launches the application and the `MainWindow` creates a new `ViewPanelPlaceholder` container that hosts the `ViewPanel`.
. `MainWindow` calls `Logic` which in turn calls `Model` to obtain a current active list through `getCurrentFilteredItemList()`.
Depending on the user's current list in view, it will either be an `XpireItemList` or `ReplenishList`.
. On starting of the GUI, `MainWindow` makes a call to `fillInnerParts()` , where the `MainWindow` passes the list as parameters to the constructor of the `ViewPanel`.
. `ViewPanel` makes a call to `displayItems(ObservableList)` and constructs a Collection of `ItemCard` by mapping each `XpireItem` or `Item`
to an `ItemCard` .
.`ItemCard` takes as parameters the item and its index in the list. It renders all fields of an `XpireItem` and `Item` and also
dose an additional check on the condition of the `XpireItem` and assign it to different colours respectively through `setColour()`.
. The app then starts.

Let's now see what happens when a command is executed.
[NOTE]
If the command is a `help`, `exit` of `export`, the `ViewPanel` will not be updated and refreshed.

. In `MainWindow`, a call to `executeCommand(String)` is made, where `Logic` will executes the command.
. Upon a successful execution, a call to `updateViewPanel()` is made. In this method the `ViewPanel` then calls `displayItems(ObservableList)` again to rerender the items.
. `displayItems` will first have to clear all child Nodes that the `ViewPanel` contains before adding a new Collection of `ItemCard`.
. `ViewPanelPlaceholder` will then have to remove the `ViewPanel` child and add the new one to allow the changes to be reflected in the GUI.

You can refer to the activity diagram below for reference.

image::UpdateViewPanelActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
If the execution by `Logic` is not successful, an error will be thrown and the `ViewPanel` will not be updated and refreshed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How ViewPanel and AllItemsPanel updates
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates taking in the lists as parameters.
** Pros: Straightforward implementation that grantees correct result if the list is correct.
** Cons: It breaks the "Model View Controller" structure because the UI is not listening to the `ObservableList` anymore. Whenever a command is executed, a function
call has to be made to update the `ViewPanel` and the `AllItemsPanel`.

* **Alternative 2:** Updates using event listeners
** Pros: It follows the MVC structure where the panels listen to the `ObservableList` for changes.
** Cons: As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to use event listeners on the `SortedUniqueList` because the listener will catch the sorting
as modification to the items. In the future, alternative 2 can be considered with changes to how the listener and sorting works.

===== Aspect: Layout of ResultDisplay
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Directly on top of the CommandBox with resizablility.
** Pros: Long messages can be viewed and referred to when typing the next comment.
** Cons: It takes up a fixed space on the GUI which could be used to display more items.

* **Alternative 2 (initial implementation):** Use a pop up window to display the messages which disappears when
any key is pressed and the user can continue.
** Pros: It saves spaces on the GUI and success and error message can be dismissed so that user do not have to see it all the time.
** Cons: User is not able to type while referring to the message.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

Refer to the guide <<Documentation#, here>>.

== Testing

Refer to the guide <<Testing#, here>>.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

We use Gradle for build automation. See <<UsingGradle#, here>> for more details.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project. See <<UsingTravis#, here>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews

We use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to preview the HTML pages of any modified asciidocs files when reviewing pull requests. See <<UsingNetlify#, here>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Follow the steps below to make a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.4`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you have created.

=== Managing Dependencies

Xpire often depends on third-party libraries. For instance, the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] is being used for JSON parsing in Xpire. Below are 2 ways to manage these _dependencies_:

* Use Gradle to manage and automatically download dependencies (Recommended).
* Manually download and include those libraries in the repo (this requires extra work and bloats the repo size).

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Command Box
. Input length limit

.. Test case: `add|an item with a very long name that will be rejected|09/09/2020|100` +
  Expected: Input is truncated to `add|an item with a very long name that will be rejected|09/0` and turns red. +
  Feedback to user that the maximum length of input cannot exceed 60 characters.

. Retrieving previous commands

.. Prerequisites: Some command have been entered by pressing kbd:[enter], and the tester is not already at the least recent command.
.. Test case: kbd:[↑] +
  Expected: Previously entered command is retrieved into the Command Box.

. Retrieving later commands

.. Prerequisites: The tester has retrieved at least one previous commands and nothing has been entered since the retrieval.
.. Test case: kbd:[↓] +
  Expected: A command that had been entered after the current retrieved command is retrieved into he Command Box.

=== All Items Panel
. Updating the All Items Panel

.. Prerequisites: Current view is the main list.
.. Test case: `add|apple|09/09/2020` +
  Expected: All Items Panel should be updated to display the item under "tracking items".

.. Test case: `search|b` +
  Expected: All Items Panel should not be updated.

.. Test case: `shift|1` +
  Expected: Item with index 1 is shifted from "tracking items" to "to-buy items".

=== View Panel

. Updating the colour of `ItemCard`

.. Prerequisites: Current view in the main list and the first item in `View` has not expired. It should not have a reminder and should be expiring in less than 1000 days.

.. Test case: Follow the instructions under <<Adding expired items to the tracking list for testing>> to add expired items to the Xpire. Do not
add any reminder threshold. +
  Expected: The expired items are marked as red; not expired items are green.

.. Test case: `set reminder|1|1000` +
  Expected: the first item turns yellow.

=== Adding expired items to the tracking list for testing

Xpire automatically tags items as `Expired` in the tracking list once an item's expiry date has passed, as seen in the diagram below. See <<Replenish List>> for details.

.Expiry date should be updated to one that has passed to test for expired items in Xpire.
image::xpire_json_file.png[]

.. By design, our app does not accept items that have expired unless the json file is tampered with.
.. To add an expired item to the tracking list, open the xpire.json file in an editor. Under `"xpireItems"`, add a new JSON object with values for `name`, `expiryDate`, `quantity`, `reminderThreshold` and `tags`.
.. The expiry date should be a date that is before the current date of testing. The reminder threshold should be a non-negative integer and quantity should be a positive integer.
.. Compute the reminder date by subtracting the reminder threshold from the expiry date. The reminder date should not be before 1/10/2019.
.. The format to follow for adding an item can be seen within the box outline:

.Format to follow for adding an XpireItem manually to xpire.json file
image::json_format_example.png[]

Example:

.Example of a valid XpireItem manually added to xpire.json file
image::json_example.png[]
An item with `name` Jelly and `expiryDate` 24/6/2019 (which has passed) is now added to the json file for your testing.

[NOTE]
Remember to enclose these name-value items with `{` and `}`.
Do note that if you manually tamper with the xpire.json file, the data file might be corrupted.
See <<Saving data>> on details for corrupted files.
For more information about JSON objects, please refer to https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json[this tutorial].

=== Deleting an item

. Deleting an item while all items are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all items using the `view` command. Multiple items in the list.
.. Test case: `delete|1` +
   Expected: First item is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted item shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete|0` +
   Expected: No item is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete|x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

. Deleting an item quantity

The examples given below acts according to the following list:

image::delete_example_list.png[]

.. Prerequisites: Input quantity to be deleted must be less than or equals to the item quantity.

   Expected: Second item from the list has quantity reduced by 3. The item is shifted to the replenish list.
   Details of this shift is reflected in the status message.
.. Test case `delete|2|0` +
   Expected: Quantity is not reduced. Error details showed in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete|x` (where x is larger than the item's quantity) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
