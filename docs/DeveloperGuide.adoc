== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `XpireParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an item).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Xpire data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Xpire`, which `Item` can reference. This would allow `Xpire` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Item` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/io/xpire/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Xpire data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `io.xpire.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag:tobuylist[]
=== [Proposed] ToReplenish/ToBuy List
==== Implementation
_{Explain here how the ToReplenish/ToBuy List is implemented}_

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how the operation works:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How ToReplenish/ToBuy List executes

** Cons:

* **Alternative 2:**

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the items
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
** Pros:
** Cons:

* **Alternative 2:**
** Pros:
** Cons:
// end::tobuylist[]

// tag:autosort[]
=== Auto-sorting of items by name then date
==== Implementation
The auto-sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortedUniqueItemList` which replaces `UniqueItemList`.

`SortedUniqueItemList` supports the following new function(s):

* `SortedUniqueItemList#setMethodOfSorting()` -- Specifies the MethodOfSorting and comparator to be used for the list.

In `SortedUniqueItemList`, items are stored in a `SortedList<Item>` and sorted based on the comparator specified.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the auto-sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how the auto-sorting mechanism works:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How auto-sorting executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatic sorting with the addition of every item.
** Pros: Slightly more efficient algorithm for viewing items in O(1) time.
** Cons: Slightly less efficient algorithm for adding items.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when items are viewed.
** Pros: Slightly more efficient algorithm for adding items in O(1) time.
** Cons: Slightly less efficient algorithm for viewing items.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the auto-sorted items
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `SortedList<Item>`.
** Pros: Smooth integration with the internal ObservableList. Comparator can also be easily changed when necessary.
** Cons: Sorted List can only be viewed when `asUnmodifiableObservableList()` in `SortedUniqueItemList` is called.

* **Alternative 2:** `TreeSet<Item>`.
** Pros: Disallows addition of identical items to the set.
** Cons: May not be as compatible with the internalList which is of type ObservableList.
// end::autosort[]

// tag:setreminder[]
=== Set Reminders for expiring items
==== Implementation
The set reminder function is facilitated by `FilteredItemList`, in which the old item will
be replaced by a new one with its `reminderThreshold` field updated. It is activated using the command `set reminder`.

You can refer to the example usage scenario given below to see what happens at each stage of the execution.

Scenario: the user wants to activate a reminder for an item with index 1 in the current view of the list
1 day before its expiry date.

Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

The reminder is now set up and is reflected in the UI like this:

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CloneModel` and `StackManager`.
It is a separate class that stores a state of the model at any command in time. +
Internally, it runs three private functions that copy the data over.

The mechanism is supported by a StackManager which stores internally all the states and +
decides when to pop or clear, depending on the command.
There are two stacks that are stored in StackManager internally, the Undo and the Redo stack.
These stacks are initialised and cleared upon beginning/ending every session.

At every command (Other than undo/redo/help/exit), the state is stored internally. +
When an undo command is executed, it will pop the previous state and update the model via `updateModel`. +
The state that was undid will then be pushed into the Redo stack, should the user types in a redo command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The two internal stacks in `StackManager` will be initialised.

Both stacks should be empty as there are no previous commands by the user. The current state is s0, the initial state of Xpire.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep1.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete|5` command to delete the 5th item in Xpire. The `delete` will then save the previous state, s0 by pushing it into the Undo Stack.

The current state will be the new state `s1` that has the 5th item in Xpire deleted.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep2.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add|Apple|30/10/2019|3` to add a new item. Similar to Step 2, The `add` command will then save the previous state, s1 by pushing it into the Undo Stack.

The current state will be the new state `s2` with the item Apple added.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep3.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not save the previous state, thus the Xpire state will not be pushed into the UndoStack.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the item was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will then update the current model with the model in the previous state.

Internally within StackManager, the most recent state, s1, will be popped from the Undo Stack to become the current state. At the same time, s2, the new state with the added item, will be pushed into the Redo Stack.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep4.png[]

[NOTE]
If there are no commands to undo (e.g. at the start of a new Xpire session), undo will return an Error to the user instead. This is done by checking whether the UndoStack is empty.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works (TO BE UPDATED):

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- It will pop the latest state from the Redo Stack and set it as the current state whilst pushing the current state into the Undo Stack.

[NOTE]
Similarly, if there are no commands to redo, redo will return an Error to the user. This is done by checking if the Redo Stack is empty.

From Step 4, there are 3 scenarios which showcases the behaviour of StackManager after an Undo Command has been executed.

Step 5a. The user suddenly decides that he should not have undid the previous AddCommand, thus he wants to redo the action. This is done by inputting 'redo' in Xpire.

Internally within Stack Manager, the current state will be the popped state, s2, from the Redo Stack. The current state, s1, will then be psuehd back into the Undo Stack.

The current states and their locations should be the same as after the execution of the Add command in Step 3.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5a.png[]

Step 5b. The user decides to further undo his actions, which now includes the first Delete command. The initial state, s0, will then be popped from the Undo Stack and set as the current state.

The current state, s1, will then be pushed into the Redo Stack.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5b.png[]

Step 5c. The user may also decide to execute some other command (which is the most likely scenario) other than Undo/Redo. For instance, the user inputs `tag|2|#Fruit`

When this happens, the existing states in the Redo Stack will be cleared. The state s1, will then be pushed into the Undo Stack whilst the current state will be the new state s3 that includes the new Tag command.

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoStep5c.png[]

[NOTE]
Not all commands will save states to StackManager. Exit and Help commands will not save states. Undo and Redo commands should only act on commands that update the items or change the view of the items to the user.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedo/UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire model.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the item being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. +
Hard to do when we are applying stackable search/sort commands.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of model states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update the filtered list shown to the user and the backend Xpire data.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag:recommendations[]
=== Spelling correction with alternative recommendations
==== Implementation
The spelling correction mechanism is based primarily on the Damerau–Levenshtein distance algorithm, which computes the edit distance between two strings.
This distance is based on the number of substitutions, deletions, insertions or transpositions of characters, needed to convert the source string into the target string.
Relevant functions supporting this operation are implemented in `StringUtil`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works with recommendations:

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works with recommendations:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an unknown command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How recommendations execute

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays recommendations after user inputs command that fails to produce results.
** Pros: Simpler and straightforward implementation.
** Cons: May be less intuitive to the user as opposed to auto-completed commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Auto-completion of commands.
** Pros: Lowers likelihood of spelling mistakes in user input to begin with.
** Cons: We must ensure that the structure of every single command and their variations are taken into consideration.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the recommendations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a TreeMap to store entries that comprise a set of recommendations and their corresponding edit distance.
** Pros: Entries are automatically sorted by their edit distance, thus words with a smaller edit distance will be recommended first. Duplicate entries are also prohibited.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Store all possible recommendations in a long list.
** Pros: Simpler implementation.
** Cons: Not closely related words may also be recommended to the user.

// end::recommendations[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
