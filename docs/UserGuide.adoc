== Introduction

Xpire is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expiry dates of items*. More importantly, Xpire is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have trouble tracking your items' expiry dates, Xpire can help you manage and notify you of items that are soon-expiring. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `xpire.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Xpire.
.  Launch the jar file using the `java -jar` command to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*view*|main` : views all items in the main list
* `*check*|20` : views items that are going to expire within 20 days
* `*add*|Banana|25/9/2020` : adds an item named `Banana` with expiry date `25/9/2020` to list
* `*delete*|3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* `*exit*` : exits the app

.  Xpire not only has a list to track you perishable items, but also a *to-buy* list (replenish list). You can move your items from the
tracking list to the replenish list once they are consumed or expired.
* `*shift*|1` : moves the 1st item from the tracking list (main list) to the replenish list

.  Some commands are only applicable for items in the tracking list. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Graphic User Interface

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

There are two lists shown on the Graphic User Interface(GUI), `View` and `All Items`. On the left is the `View` list.
This is an active list that shows you the current view of items. As you manipulate the items using
`search`, or `check`, `View` list will change accordingly to show you only the items you want to see.

image::ItemCard.png[width="710"]

This is how your item will look like in the `View` list. The number on the right is the number of days left before the item expires.

The colour of the item card changes according to
the status of your item. +

* An *expired* item will be red. +

image::Expired.png[width="500]

* An item that is *expiring soon* will be yellow. You can set when to mark an item yellow based
on individual cases. See more information here: <<Reminder>>.

image::ReminderCard.png[width="500]

* An item that has *not expired* and is not going to expire soon will be green.

image::ItemCard.png[width="710"]

If the name or other details of the item is shortened with `...`, you can click on the card to expand it.

image::ShortenedCard.png[width="500"]
image::ExpandCard.png[width="500"]


You can find all your items on the right, in the `All Items` list.

image::AllItems.png[width="300"]

The `All Items` list provides you with a static view of all your items in the app in alphabetical order. Here items are categorized into tracked items and to-buy items. You can click on the list
name to view items in the list, or click again to collapse the list. Clicking on the item name will show you the
expiry date of the item if it has one.

Below the `View` list panel, you can find a rectangle box which acts like a "feedback window".

image::FeedbackBox.png[width="500"]

Any feedback on
the successful execution of the command will be displayed in this box. If an illegal command is entered, you will
also be able to see a failure message and relevant suggestions in the box.

Finally, at the very bottom, you can find a small rounded rectangle box that says "Enter command here...".

image::CommandBox.png[width="500"]

This is where you can type your command. The maximum you can type is 60 characters. Try typing `add|Banana|1/11/2020` and press kbd:[enter], and you will see it appears in your `View` list!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words that are enclosed with `<` and `>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `set reminder|<index>|<reminder threshold>`, `<index>` and `<reminder threshold>` are parameters which can be used as `set reminder|1|7`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `check[|<days>]` can be used as `check|7` or `check`.
* Optional parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. For example, for [<other tags>]... in the following format for Tag Command: `tag|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...` can be used as `tag|1|#Fruit #Frozen #Cold` or `tag|1|#Fruit`.
* Trailing `|` (s) are allowed. e.g. `add|banana|2/2/2020|||` or `sort|name|`.

[[Reminder]]
==== Setting reminder for an item: `set reminder`

===== Setting the number of days before an item's expiry date to start reminding you
.Reminder set for item at index 4
image::set-reminder.png[width="790"]

Sets a reminder for your item. +
Format: `set reminder|<index>|<reminder threshold>`

Reminder threshold refers to *the number of days before the item's expiry date*. By setting the reminder threshold
of an item to n days, the app will start reminding you of this items n days before its expiry date.

This allows the check command to quickly find the item once the reminder threshold is exceeded, and also
allows the item to be marked as yellow in `View`.

****
* All items have their default reminder threshold set to 0.
* To reset a reminder threshold, simply write over the old one.
* A reminder cannot be set to be before the current date. For example, if the current date is 20/9/2019
, it is not possible to set the reminder on 19/9/2019. In other words, if an item is expiring in 4 days, we cannot start the reminder 5 days before its expiry date. Instead, the app understands that you want the reminder to
be activated immediately, and will start the reminder on the current date.
****

Examples:

* `set reminder|2|4` +
Sets a reminder for the second item in the list 4 days before its expiry date.

===== Removing the reminder for an item
Removes the reminder set for your item.
Format: `set reminder|<index>|0`

Examples:

* `set reminder|1|0` +
Removes the reminder for the first item in the list.
// end::set reminder[]

// tag::check[]
==== Listing expiring items: `check`

===== Listing all expiring items with activated reminders
.Items expiring soon listed
image::check.png[width="790"]

Lists items whose reminder has been activated. +
Format: `check`

===== Listing items that will expire within a certain number of days

Lists items that will expire within the specified number of days in your tracker. +
Format: `check|<days>`

****
* Number of days *must be a non-negative integer* 0,1,2,3,..
****

[TIP]
`check|0` lists items that have already expired or expire on the day of checking.

Examples:

* `check|20` +
Lists items expiring in the next 20 days.
// end::check[]

// tag::sort[]
==== Sorting all items : `sort`
Sorts all items in your list by their name or date. +
Format: `sort|<key>`

****
* Items can be sorted by either name or date.
* For example, Apple will sort ahead of Banana, while 1/1/790 will sort ahead of 1/1/2001.
****
===== Sorting all items by their name
Format: `sort|name`

===== Sorting all items by their date
.Items sorted by their date
image::sort-date.png[width="790"]

Format: `sort|date`
// end::sort[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
//=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

//_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]

==== Undo previous command : `undo`
Undo the previous command that you have entered in. +
Format: `undo`

[TIP]
`undo` only works on commands that alter your items or the current view list. Thus, commands such as `help` and `sort` are not undoable as they do not alter items or the current view list.

==== Redo an earlier command : `redo`
Redo an earlier command that you have entered in. +
Format: `redo`

This command works in the opposite direction as `undo`, it will redo any command that you have undid so you are able to see the changes.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Xpire folder.
