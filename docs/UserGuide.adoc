== Introduction

Xpire is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expiry dates of items*. More importantly, Xpire is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have trouble tracking your items' expiry dates, Xpire can help you manage and notify you of items that are soon-expiring. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `xpire.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Xpire.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*view*` : views all items
* `*check*|20` : views items that is going to expire within the given number of days
* `*add*|Banana|25/9/2019` : adds an item named `Banana` with expiry date `25/9/2019` to list.
* `*delete*|3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* `*exit*` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `check[|<days>]` can be used as `check|7` or `check`.
* Optional parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `tag|<index>|[<tag>]...` can be used as `tag|1|#Fruit #Frozen #Cold`, `tag|1`, or `tag|1|#Fruit`.

=== Adding an item: `add`

Adds an item to your tracker. +
Upon addition of the item, the updated list sorted by name then date in chronological order, will be displayed. +

Examples:

* `add|durian|30/9/2020` (without quantity) +
Adds the item `durian` with expiry date `30/9/2019` with quantity `1`

****

[TIP]
For items with single quantity, you can save time by keying in only the item name and expiry date.

=== Listing all items : `view`

Shows all items in the list. +
All items are sorted by both name (lexicographical order) and date (chronological order). +
Format: `view`

=== Setting reminder for an item: `set reminder`

Sets a reminder threshold for your item. +
Format: `set reminder|<index>|<reminder threshold>`

This allows the check command to quickly find the item once the reminder threshold is exceeded.

****
* Reminder threshold refers to *the number of days before the item's expiry date* to activate the reminder.
* All items have their default reminder threshold set to 0.
* To reset a reminder threshold, simply write over the old one.
* To delete a reminder, reset the reminder threshold to 0.
****

Examples:

* `set reminder|2|4` +
Sets a reminder for the second item in the list 4 days before its expiry date.
* `set|1|0` +
Removes the reminder for the first item in the list.

=== Listing expiring items : `check`

Lists items that will expire within the specified number of days in your tracker. +
Format: `check|<days>`

Lists items whose reminder has been activated. +
Format: `check`

* Number of days *must be a non-negative integer* 0,1,2,3,..
****

[TIP]
`check|0` lists items that have already expired or expire on the day of checking.

Examples:

* `check`
* `check|20` +
Lists items expiring in the next 20 days.

=== Sorting all items : `sort`

Sorts all items in your list by either name or date. +
Format: `sort|<key>`

* Items can be sorted by either name or date.
* For example, Apple will sort ahead of Banana, while 1/1/2000 will sort ahead of 1/1/2001.
****

Examples:

* `sort|name`
* `sort|date`


=== Searching item by name: `search`

Searches for items whose names or tag(s) contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `search|<keyword>[|<other keywords>]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `ham` will match `Ham` and `#fruit` will match `#Fruit`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Turkey Ham|Apple` will match `Apple|Turkey Ham`.
* Only the name and tag, if any, are searched.
* For name search, partial words can be matched e.g. `Papa` will match `Papayas`.
* For tag search, only exact words will be matched e.g. `#Fruit` will match `#Fruit` but `#Fru` will not match `#Fruit`.
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (an `OR` search). e.g. `Apple|Pear` will return `Granny Smith Apple` and `Japanese Pear`.
* If no items are found, any closely related keywords, if any, will be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `search|kebab` +
Returns `Chicken Kebab` and `kebab`
* `search|Chicken Ham` +
