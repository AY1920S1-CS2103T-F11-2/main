== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

My team and I were tasked to morph an existing Desktop application called AddressBook3 for our Software Engineering Team Project (Module Code: CS2103T). Our team has chosen to morph the application into an Expiry Date Tracker named Xpire that targets students living in residences and halls.

Our application allows users to track expiry dates of items and be reminded when they are about to expire. Examples of items that can be tracked include perishable items such as Milk, Bread, Fruits or even non-perishable items such as Medicine and Passwords. +

Our application also features a ReplenishList where users can track what items they need to replenish after it expires or has been used up.

== Xpire Interface

Currently, this is what our project, Xpire, looks like in v1.4:

== Formatting used in this Project Portfolio

`undo` - This grey highlight represents a class, a variable or method that exists in the codebase. It can also represent a command that has to be entered into the application.

`Xpire` - This refers to the main list in the application and not the entire application. The Xpire application will be simply referred to as 'the application'.

`ReplenishList` - This refers to the replenish list in the application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a tagging command that allows users to tag items in Xpire so that they are able to search it up easily and group items together easily.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*: In-charge of writing tests as well as approving tests written by other members.

*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
